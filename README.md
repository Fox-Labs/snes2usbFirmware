## Project based on:
This is based on a project from Raphnet:

Homepage: http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/2nes2usb/index_en.php

GitHub: http://github.com/raphnet/2nes2usb

## Supported micro-controller(s)

Currently supported micro-controller(s):

* Atmega8
* Atmega168

Adding support for other micro-controllers should be easy, as long as the target has enough
IO pins, enough memory (flash and SRAM) and is supported by V-USB.

## Built with

* [avr-gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc)
* [avr-libc](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/)
* [gnu make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
